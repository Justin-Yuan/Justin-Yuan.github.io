<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I obtained my MASc degree in RL and Robotics from [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), advised by [Angela Schoellig](https://www.dynsyslab.org/prof-angela-schoellig/) at [Dynamic Systems Lab (DSL)](https://www.dynsyslab.org/vision-news/), also part of [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) and [UofT Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/). Previously, I received my BASc degree in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) from UofT. I was also an intern in Nvidia Toronto AI lab advised by [Sanja Fidler](https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/), Apple Siri team based in Seattle, and Data-Driven Decision Making Lab advised by [Scott Sanner](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/sanner/). My prior works largely focus on safe RL, transfer learning, and Sim-to-Real tasks.

I currently work at Qualcomm to develop **multi-modal Transformer models for mobile/on-device applications**, exploring various topics such as model distillation, quantization, and parameter efficient finetuning for LLMs or other foundation models. 

In my leisure time, I play fingerstyle guitar :guitar: and badminton :badminton:.
